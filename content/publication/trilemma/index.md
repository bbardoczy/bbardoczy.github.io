summary: "We show that New Keynesian models with frictionless labor supply face a challenge: given
standard parameters, they cannot simultaneously match plausible estimates of marginal propen-
sities to consume (MPCs), marginal propensities to earn (MPEs), and fiscal multipliers. A
HANK model with sticky wages provides a solution to this trilemma."
