abstract: "We propose a method to solve dynamic general equilibrium models in which agents have arbitrary, time-variant beliefs about equilibrium outcomes that may deviate from rational expectations. Under some restrictions on heterogeneity in beliefs, our approach is readily applicable to quantitative models with rich microeconomic heterogeneity. We apply our method to study the power of state-dependent unemployment insurance (UI) in stabilizing short-run fluctuations. Our laboratory is a standard Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian model with search frictions. Managing expectations is key in this application because higher UI generosity raises consumption, partly, by reducing precautionary saving. If the policy is implemented as a contingent rule that indexes benefits to the unemployment rate, households have to forecast it to anticipate the policy stance. First, we solve the model with a list of popular models of belief formation from the literature, including sticky expectations, k-level thinking, cognitive discounting, adaptive learning and more. These are all special cases of the general framework. Second, we solve the model with a flexible semi-parametric model of beliefs that we estimate from systematic forecast errors of the unemployment rate in the Survey of Professional Forecasters. We find large efficiency loss, in terms of output stabilization, due to imperfect anticipation of higher benefits."
