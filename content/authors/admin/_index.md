I am an Economist at the [Federal Reserve Board of Governors](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/bence-a-bardoczy.htm), where I serve in the [Macroeconomic and Quantitative Studies](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/rsmaqs-staff.htm) section within the Division of Research and Statistics. My research focuses on how micro heterogeneity interacts with the macroeconomy and affects economic policy.

This is a personal website. The views expressed on this website are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve System.
